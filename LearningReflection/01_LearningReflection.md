> Please use the below questions as guidelines to help you think and plan your Learning Reflection Report

## 1. How was your experience testing the given Webapp?
- Testing the web application was an educational experience. It helped me understand the practical aspects of quality assurance and gave me insight into how test cases relate to real-world software functionality.
     

## 2. How did you write or manage your test case? Describe the process.
- I followed the provided template and instructions. I analyzed each web page's functionality, then wrote test cases using the structured format with sections like Settings, Variables, and Test Steps. I also made sure each test case could be repeated and understood clearly.
    

## 3. Do you recommend any other tools or styles for Test case management. 
 - For small projects, even simple spreadsheets or markdown files are effective if structured well. I would recommend to test tools like TestRail or Jira for managing large numbers of test cases. 


## 4. Which IDE (Visual Code or Atom or else) have you used to edit files?
- I used Visual Studio Code. It's fast, user-friendly, and has useful extensions for working with various file formats.


## 5. Did you find any trouble? how did you solve the trouble?
- Yes, I had some difficulties understanding how to format the test case steps correctly at first. I reviewed the sample login test case and compared it to my own writing to make sure I followed the correct format.

## 6. Did you find any trouble using Github? have you used Github before? where?
- I had used GitHub before for school projects, but this was the first time I needed to share a structured assignment through it. 


## 7. If in the future if you need to automate these test cases, which framework or language will you use? and describe why (Robot Framework, Cypress, Selenium, or any other )
- I would use Robot Framework because it has a readable syntax and integrates well with Selenium for UI automation. It's beginner-friendly and works well with Python, which I am already familiar with.


## 8. Kindly search the term `Tester` `Automation Tester` glassdoor and LinkedIn or any other job search website. Currently, list the skills and competencies that are most in-demand in software testing
- Common in-demand skills include:
Selenium or Cypress
Robot Framework
Test planning and documentation
API testing (e.g., Postman, REST APIs)
CI/CD tools like Jenkins
Programming languages like Python or Java


## 9. **Let's assume** that if you are going to continue with the career in Software Testing, which technical and soft skills do you need to fill up the blank in your resume?
- Technical: Improve my skills in automation testing tools, scripting languages like Python, and version control with Git.
- Soft: Stronger communication, problem-solving, and collaboration skills in agile teams.


## 10. Write short Learning Reflection and  Free words Do you think that project helped in putting theoretical knowledge into practice? Describe? (is there anything else that you would like to share with us concerning the current study module). e.g. regarding the quality of content and your learning (or) improvement ideas? 
- Yes, this project was very helpful. It allowed me to apply theory in a hands-on way, such as writing real test cases and using GitHub for collaboration. It also made me realize the importance of structure and clarity in QA work. I appreciated the detailed templates and instructions, which made the process much easier to follow.
